            <h1>Be a Guest on The CircuitPython Show</h1>
                        <p>I am always looking to talk to people who are doing cool things with CircuitPython,
                            microcontrollers, Python, or other maker related things. Don't let the show name
                            fool you, it's not always just about CircuitPython.
                        </p>

                        <h2>You and a topic</h2>
                        <p><ul class="text-white">
                            <li>You don't have to be an expert or a professional speaker to be a great.
                                I want to talk with people who have something interesting to share.
                                It can be about CircuitPython, microcontrollers, Python, or anything related to the
                                maker community.</li>
                            <li>You can contact me via the email link at the bottom of the page or DM me on Twitter.
                                I'm happy to discuss potential topic ideas with you.</li>
                            <li>My goal is about a 15 - 20 minute episode.  Some are a little shorter, some are
                                a little longer.  As long as the conversation is natural and interesting, it
                                always works out.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>

                        <h2>Before the show</h2>
                        <p><ul class="text-white">
                            <li>Schedule some time with me.  I usually recommend a 15 minute pre-interview where we get a 
                                chance to meet, review the topics, and I can answer any questions you might have.
                                I'll share a link for you to put a meeting on my calendar - schedule for when it's
                                convenient for you!</li>
                            <li>I'll share a Google Doc with you where you can add any articles or videos I
                                should review, if any.  I'll also want to capture your bio, pronunciation,
                                pronouns, and any other information.</li>
                            <li>A headphone and mic are recommended, but your laptop can work in a pinch,
                                though I highly recommend a  pair of headphones to avoid any potential feedback.</li>
                            <li>I'll share the link to Zencastr in the Google Doc for our recording session.
                                Unfortunately, Zencastr does not work with Firefox, you'll need to use Chrome,
                                Safari, or Edge.</li>
                                <li>Let me know if there is anything you want to make sure is covered.</li>
                        </ul></p>

                        <h2>It's Showtime!</h2>
                            <p><ul class="text-white">
                                <li>We both log in to Zencastr and chat for a few minutes and review some of the above.</li>
                                <li>I'll double check your personal info and give you a headsup when it's time to start.</li>
                                <li>I typically pre-record the intro, including your bio, and I'll welcome you to the show.</li>
                                <li>I'll ask you a few questions, and we'll have a chat.  It'll be fun! </li>
                                <li>Feel free to ask any clarifying questions you might have.</li>
                                <li>The podcast is edited, removing any "uhs", "umms", or big breaths.
                                    We can cut out bloopers and other misc. sounds, too.</li>
                                <li>Feel free to pause before giving an answer and don't forget to breathe.</li>
                                <li>We'll end the show with two segments.  One, where it's your turn to ask me a
                                    question of your choosing.  (I'll share a Google Doc with previously asked
                                    questions.)  The other, I'll ask you what microcontroller you reach for when
                                    starting a new project.  If you don't want to do one of the segments, just let me know.</li>
                            </ul></p>

                                <h2>At the end of the show</h2>

                                    <li>I'll thank you for being on the show and hopefully remember to ask you a call to action, 
                                        where people can find you or reach you. </li>
                                    <li>Wait to close your window for a few seconds after the show, it takes Zencastr
                                        a few moments to finalize the recording.  We can briefly chat, and I'll let
                                        you know the upcoming schedule for when your episode will probably air and
                                        answer any other questions.</li>
