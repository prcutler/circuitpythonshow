            <p>
                Paul Cutler is a married father of three, living in the suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
                When he's not attending his kids sports activities or introducing them to classic 80s movies, 
                you can find him listening to records from his vinyl collection, tinkering with Python or CircuitPython, 
                playing with his dog, or watching a movie.</p>

            <p>
                Paul believes strongly in the power of open source, both software and hardware.  Paul has contributed
                to a number of open source projects in the past, most notably with <a href="https://gnome.org">GNOME</a>.
                In the past, he contributed to GNOME's marketing and system administration teams; was the managing editor of
