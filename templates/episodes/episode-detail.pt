                Paul Cutler is a married father of three, living in the suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
                When he's not attending his kids sports activities or introducing them to classic 80s movies, 
                you can find him listening to records from his vinyl collection, tinkering with Python or CircuitPython, 
                playing with his dog, or watching a movie.</p>

        <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>
                Thank you to everyone who has contributed anything to CircuitPython and / or Python.  Thank you
                to <a href="https://talkpython.fm">Talk Python to Me</a>, where I have learned almost all of the 
                Python I know, starting from their first Kickstarter through the 
                <a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/full-html-web-applications-with-fastapi">Full Web Apps with FastAPI course</a> 
                to build this site. The show also inspired me to start this podcast, and thank you to the host, Michael Kennedy, 
                for answering all my questions when starting out. Thank you to Brian Okken, 
                host of the <a href="https://testandcode.com">Test and Code podcast</a>, 
                whose podcast interview prep I have shamelessly stole (with his permission, of course). </p>

                <p>
                The CircuitPython community wouldn't be who it is without the <a href="http://adafru.it/discord">Adafruit Discord</a>.  
                Thanks to everyone who has answered one of my many questions.  
                </p>
                <p>
                Lastly, thank you for listening and taking a chance on the show.
                </p>
